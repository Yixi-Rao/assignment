        <p> <b style="color: rgb(39, 163, 80)"> What I have learnt </b></p>
        <p> In my previous knowledge, I thought website development was just writing codes. After taking this course, I realize 
            that website is not just editing html and css, but also includes the website layout design, website interactive design and 
            website visual design. In order to design a good website, we should consider many aspects, for example, the visual aspect which means we should 
            include spme images with text or using some diagrams ot tables to visulize data. </p>
        <p> <b style="color: rgb(39, 163, 80)"> Improvements </b></p>
        <p> 1. the overall layout could can be done better, I found some very interesting and wonderful layout pattern on some websites, such as I can make a
            blurred background image to my index page which will attract the visitor's interest and highlight the topic of my theme. 
        </p>
        <p>
            2. I think my site map is not a good design, because it is just the plain text which might be very boring for the visitor. My website is an introduction of a game, and 
            game always has some attrative images(e.g. game characters, weapons...) and some very cool art design. All of this can attract the visitor's interest and Prevent visitors from leaving my website.
            Therefore, I will integrate the image map idea into site map if I can do it again.
